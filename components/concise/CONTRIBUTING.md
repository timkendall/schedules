# Contributing to Concise

Welcome to Concise! We are not only here to make it as simple as possible to build websites, but also to contribute to the project.

By following this guide to contributing, we can make sure that everything is up to code (pun intended), everything is formatted properly, and we are posting bug reports, feature requests, and questions in the proper area.

Sound good? **Let's move on...**

# Bug reports, feature requests, and questions

** *Thanks to [thoughtbot](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/moving-open-source-project-mailing-lists-to-stack-overflow) for this great way to handling questions for an open source project.*

In lieu of a mailing list, we are going to manage all specific questions through [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).

Members of the Concise team are subscribed to specific tags via [Stack Exchange Filters](http://stackexchange.com/filters) so that if a question is properly tagged, we can respond in a timely manner and help. 

**Which tags?**

Ideally, we would like to keep it to just one tag for Concise questions, but we are subscribed to multiple variants to make sure nothing passes by us. However, for everybody asking a question, please use:

- [Concise](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/concise)

**Where do I post this?**

There are lots of different things that people will want to post regarding the Concise framework. Here is a rough outline of where you should post any given issue, question or contribution: 

- Use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) if you **need help**
- Use [GitHub Issues](http://github.com/ConciseCSS/concise.css/issues) if you **found a bug**
- Use [GitHub Issues](http://github.com/ConciseCSS/concise.css/issues) if you **have an idea**
- Use [GitHub Issues](http://github.com/ConciseCSS/concise.css/issues) if you want to **ask a question**
- Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) if you **want to contribute**

# Feature Requests

Do you think that there should be something in Concise that isn't already included? Before you start writing code and implementing a feature, make sure that it is something that fits into the idea and scope of the project. We are a lightweight, bloat-free framework that focuses on removing the unnecessary. 

If you are unsure of whether or not your feature would be a good fit for the framework, posting in [GitHub Issues](http://github.com/ConciseCSS/concise.css/issues) and tagging it `info:feedback-needed` or `type:idea` will help us filter your feature request and evaluate the idea.
